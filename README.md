# Alphamoji

This is a simple, interactive typing game created for Elly at 2.5 years old. It teaches the alphabet, emoji names and typing all together! It is inspired by many ABC books for young kids. 

This educational tool aims to introduce basic typing concepts in a fun and engaging way. It works like a puzzle to help memorizing the characters in a QWERTY keyboard. All the visual assets are emoji-based to make it more intuitive for kids. The music is generated with Suno's AI.
